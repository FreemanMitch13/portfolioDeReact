        <h2>About Me</h2>
            My name is Mitchell Freeman. I was born and raised in Alabama, where I earned both of my degrees. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Finance from Jacksonville State University and M.B.A from the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
            My professional background is in Finance with a focus on pricing and procurement. Currently, I am working as the Practice Manager for a mid size law firm in Atlanta, Georgia.
            I am currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp where I am learning the tools to become a developer. I am interested to see how what I am learning can be implemented into my current role, but also excited for the new career paths that this knowledge can hold.
